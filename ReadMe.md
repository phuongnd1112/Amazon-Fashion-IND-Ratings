# Amazon Fashion Sales and Ratings 

## Introduction 

This project explores a amazon sale data set taken from Kaggle. 
Dataset can be found [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset)

Key skills challenged:
1. Data cleaning and wrangling (as data extracted were all objects and were relatively unstructured, needing a lot of scrubbing) 

## Outcomes
I was able to visualise the statistical scoring (mean, quantiles) for ratings, number of ratings and prices in the amazon fashion product sub-group. 
Was valubale to discovered that relationships I thought existed (higher no of ratings to higher rating score,..) pretty much did not exist. 

## For Development 
- Process product title to group high rated products?
